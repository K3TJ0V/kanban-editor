# kanban-editor
My first project with more JS logic, responsive on mobile and desktop resolutions.

After changing with of the site from lower to higher, **refresh** is necesarry because of 
script used in html file which puts one element inside header,
it just made my desktop styles easier to implement.


## What is it for?

With this aplication you can organise your work by creating columns that defines importance 
of tasks created in those columns.

For example you can create column named **important** and put there tasks that need to be done.

### Additional functionality

-You are able to move your tasks between columns that you created.

-After setting your plan you have to save the state of your work so you won't lose anything. (save button is in a hamburger menu)

-Then you can just load it and check your tasks. <br>
(I've met problems with saving state on Safari, sometimes it can't hold your saved data)

-Settings button has no functionality yet. There is still space to add some features in future.
